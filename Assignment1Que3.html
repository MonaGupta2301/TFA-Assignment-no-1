      content in double qoutes.
 
      let's discuss : &lt, &gt, &le, &ge, &ldquo, &rdquo

      There are some characters which are predefined or built in HTML, and they are given as : &lt, &gt, 
      &le, &ge, &ldquo, &rdquo,etc
      
      Why they are already defined ?
      ==> Because if we want to use the greater than (>) or less Than (<) signs in html so Browser may get 
          confused tags so to over come these problem html itroduced some charcters called as &lt, &gt, &le, 
          &ge, &ldquo, &rdquo
      where,
      1) &lt     : &lt Means less than, it is used to create the less than Symbol or character (<).
      
      2) &gt     : &gt Means Greater than, it is used to create the Greater than Symbol or character (>).
      
      3) &le     : &le Means less-than equal to, it is used to create the less-than Equal to Symbol or character (<=).
      
      4) &ge     : &ge Means Greater-than equal to, it is used to create the Greater-than Equal to Symbol or character (>=).
